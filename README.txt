Create fractals! This uses Python 3.3 and Pygame 1.9.2.

Use fractals.py to generate the Sherpinsky triangle and Koch snowflake fractals using pygame.

Using mandlebrot.py to output Julia sets as well as the Mandlebrot set to a
.dat file.

Feel free to use any of my code to play, impress your friends, make money, or
conquer the world. Please just cite me. :) Have fun!
