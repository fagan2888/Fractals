Create fractals!

Use fractals.py to generate the Sherpinsky triangle (and the Koch snowflake
eventually) fractal using pygame.

Using iterfractal.py to output Julia sets as well as the Mandlebrot set to a
.dat file.

Feel free to use any of my code to play, impress your friends, make money, or
conquer the world. Please just cite me. :) Have fun!
